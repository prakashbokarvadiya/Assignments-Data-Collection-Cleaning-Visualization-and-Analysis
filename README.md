📘 Module 5: Data Collection, Cleaning, Visualization, and Analysis



This module focuses on the complete workflow of preparing and understanding data for machine learning and data science projects. It covers how to collect raw data, clean and preprocess datasets, visualize patterns, and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.



🔹 Key Topics Covered

1\. Data Collection



Understanding different data sources (APIs, databases, web scraping, CSV files)



Importing data using Python libraries such as pandas, requests, and BeautifulSoup



Handling structured and unstructured datasets



2\. Data Cleaning



Detecting and handling missing values



Removing duplicate records



Fixing incorrect or inconsistent data



Data type conversion and normalization



Handling outliers using statistical methods



3\. Data Visualization



Creating visual representations of data using matplotlib and seaborn



Plot types: bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, line charts, heatmaps



Identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies through visual charts



4\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



Summarizing data using descriptive statistics



Understanding distributions, patterns, and relationships



Feature selection and correlation analysis



Preparing insights for further modeling



🎯 Learning Outcomes



By the end of this module, you will be able to:



Collect and import real-world datasets



Clean and preprocess data efficiently



Visualize information for insight and reporting



Perform EDA to guide machine learning model building
